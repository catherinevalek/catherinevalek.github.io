    <h1>Ostrava</h1>
    <p>Ostrava is not one of the most popular tourist destinations, but it is one of my favorites. This is where I was stationed when I was teaching English. Once known for it's steel and coal industries, the people, natural areas, and public transportation are what impressed me. It is near the Beskydy Mountains and Poland is not far away. The public transportion makes it easy to visit small villages nearby.</p>

    <h2>Prague</h2>
    <p>By far the most well known city in the Czech Republic, Prague has more hustle and bustle than Ostrava. I like walking trough the Old Town Square or viewing the architecture of its castles and cathedrals. One of the most famous sites is the Charles Bridge.</p>
    <p>Some of the other cities I enjoyed visiting were:</p>
